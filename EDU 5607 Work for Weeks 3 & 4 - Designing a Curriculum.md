In this activity, students will be required to create lesson sequence plans that address the teaching of CS to students at the elementary, middle, and secondary levels. These lesson plans will focus on the teaching and development of advanced CS skills.  

Here is what this project will involve:

1. **Identify** which standard(s) , and which components of those standards) you will be addressing from the [New York State Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards](https://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards) in your Curriculum Plans. In addition to whichever other standards you select, please be sure to include *Impacts of Computing*.
2. **Think through** how you would address the same standards across the three grade bands (elementary, middle, and high). I want you to gain experience in thinking about these developmental learners and how instruction might vary in response to their developmental abilities and prior experiences.
3. **Design curricular materials** that address these standards across the three grade bands. 
4. **At least some** of your curricular plans ***must*** include physical computing tools, such as robots.

You can use whatever format for these materials that make sense to you; you are not necessarily required to use Manhattanville templates, with which you are already familiar. Although whatever format you use should include how you will evaluating and assessing student understanding AND how you will be differentiating your instruction to reach all students.
