## Introduction
This brief introduction to this Environment Science course does several things: *describing* the goals for the course; *discussing* the design principles employed; *outlining* the Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings; and *outlining* the Massachusetts learning standards addressed.

### Goal of the Course
The goal of this Environment Science course is threefold:

1. **Enhance** the science experience of incoming freshmen.
2. Allow students to **explore** the key concepts of the course through student-centered pedagogical strategies, such as: [project-based learning](https://www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning), [design thinking](https://www.ideo.com/post/design-thinking-for-educators), and [inquiry-based learning](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/what-heck-inquiry-based-learning-heather-wolpert-gawron).
3. Provide students with a **rich experience** of environmental science, sustainability, and human impact on the environment.

###  Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings

####  Essential Questions for the Course

1. Living and non-things things are connected via [**complex, adaptive systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system). When you touch one thing, you touch everything.

2. Living systems tend toward [**homeostasis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis), however humans have an outsized impact on the environment which threatens this homeostasis.

3. People can learn to come together to design solutions that can positively influence the [**sustainability**](https://www.epa.gov/sustainability/learn-about-sustainability) of our world.

#### Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings for the Course

1. How do living and non-living systems work and work together and respond to one another?

2. What is the value of diversity in terms of living and non-living systems, and how can this diversity be expanded?

3. In what ways have we had negative impacts on our world and how can we repair the damage we have caused?


### Learning Standards Addressed

This curriculum has been designed to address the Massachusetts [2016 Science and Technology Engineering Framework ](https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/scitech/2016-04.pdf).<br>


| Standard                                                     | 9-12 Description                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ESS.1.5 Earth's Place in the Universe                        | Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of continental and oceanic crust, the theory of plate tectonics, and relative densities of oceanic and continental rocks to explain why continental rocks are generally much older than rocks of the ocean floor. |
| ESS2.A Earth materials and systems                           | Feedback effects exist within and among Earth’s systems.     |
| ESS2.C The roles of water in Earth’s surface processes       | The planet’s dynamics are greatly influenced by water’s unique chemical and physical properties. |
| ESS2.D  Weather and  climate                                 | The role of radiation from the Sun and its interactions with the atmosphere, ocean,  and land are the foundation for the global  climate system. |
| ESS3.A  Natural  resources                                   | Resource availability has guided the development of human society and use of  natural resources has associated costs,  risks, and benefits, including to global  climate. |
| LS1.C  Organization for  matter and  energy flow in  organisms | Organisms are constantly breaking down and reorganizing matter. The  hydrocarbon backbones of sugars  produced through photosynthesis are  used by organisms to make amino  acids and other macromolecules that  can be assembled into proteins or  DNA. During cellular respiration, the  bonds of macromolecules and oxygen  are broken down to build new  products and transfer energy. |
| LS2.A  Interdependent  relationships in  ecosystems          | Ecosystems have carrying capacities resulting from biotic and abiotic  factors. The fundamental tension  between resource availability and  organism populations affects genetic  diversity within populations and  biodiversity within ecosystems. |
| LS2.B  Cycles of matter  and energy  transfer in  ecosystems | Photosynthesis captures energy in sunlight and stores it in chemical bonds  of matter. Most organisms rely on  cellular respiration to release energy in  these bonds to power life processes.  About 90% of available energy is lost  from one trophic level to the next,  resulting in fewer organisms at higher  levels. At each link in an ecosystem,  elements are combined in different  ways and matter and energy are  conserved. Photosynthesis, cellular  respiration and decomposition are key  components of the global carbon cycle. |
| LS2.C  Ecosystem  dynamics,  functioning, and  resilience    | If a biological or physical disturbance to  n ecosystem occurs, including one  induced by human activity, the  ecosystem may return to its more or  less original state or become a very  different ecosystem, depending on the  complex interactions within the  ecosystem. The ability of an ecosystem  to both resist and recover from change  is a measure of its overall health. |
| PS1.B  Chemical  reactions                                   | Chemical processes and  reaction rates are understood  in terms of collisions of  molecules, rearrangement of  atoms, and changes in energy  as determined by properties of  elements involved. Knowledge  of conservation of atoms with  chemical properties and  electrical charges can be used  to describe and predict  chemical reactions. Main types  of reactions include transfer of  electrons (redox) or hydronium  ions (acids/bases). Changes in  pressure, concentration, or temperature affect the balance  between forward and  backward reaction rates  (equilibrium). Ionic and  covalent bonds can be  predicted based on the types  of attractive forces between  particles. |
| PS2.B  Types of  interactions                                | Electrical forces between  electrons and the nucleus of  atoms explain chemical  patterns. Intermolecular forces  determine atomic  composition, molecular  geometry and polarity, and,  therefore, structure and  properties of substances. The  kinetic-molecular theory  describes the behavior of gas  in a system. |
| PS3.A and 3.B<br/>Definition and<br/>conservation of<br/>energy and<br/>energy transfer | The total energy within a physical system is conserved. Energy transfer within and between systems can be described and predicted in terms of energy associated with the motion or configuration of particles. |
|                                                              |                                                              |


#### Scientific Inquiry and Engineering Design Processes

Additionally, this curriculum addresses and embraces the Scientific Inquiry process and Engineering Design process outlined in that standards framework.

### Design Principles

This course was built with several design principles in mind:

1. **Interdisciplinarity**. We believe that the scientific concepts of this course, as well as the sociological ones, are inherently interdisciplinary in nature. Hence, connections between them are considered important and necessary.
2. **Hands On**. We believe that adolescents learn best when they can engage directly with materials and concepts, and so this course has been designed to include lots of hands on experiences.
3. **Autonomy Support**. We believe that adolescents learn best when they are encouraged and allowed to engage with their learning with as much autonomy as possible, consistent with research into [Self Determination Theory.](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org)
4. **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).** This course has been designed to engage adolescents deeply in the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)](https://www.un.org/en/sustainable-development-goals) and to encourage them as [Earth Citizens](https://www.earthcitizens.org/).
5. **Core Science/Math/Literacy Skills**. This course has been designed to support the development and application of core science, mathematics, and literacy skills.
