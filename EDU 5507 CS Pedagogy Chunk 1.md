# EDU 5507 - Introduction to CS Pedagogy - Spring 2024


## Course Description
This course is designed to provide teachers and teacher candidates with an introduction to the history, context, methods, and strategies for teaching Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) with students in grades K-12. Through the work of this course, teachers and teacher candidates will engage deeply in the core CS principles (Algorithms and programming, Computing systems, Data and analysis, Impacts of computing, and Networks and the Internet) and will learn to design learning environments and learning experiences that promote deep understanding of these principles in their students. The focus in this course is in developing learning experiences for ***novice*** CS learners at all age levels.

Here is the work for Week 1. As we discussed, you will be started on our two parallel projects:
* Analyzing National (mostly) Computer Science Curriculum
* Developing a Computer Science Curriculum

## Chunk 1: CS Learning Standards Analysis

In this section of the course, you will become familiar with the CS Learning Standards developed by: a)  the [New York State Education Department (NYSED)](https://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards);  and b) the [Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA)](https://csteachers.org/k12standards/interactive/).

Once you have reviewed these standards documents in detail, please prepare an analysis of them. You analysis should analyze each individually and then collectively.

Here are some prompts to get you started in this analysis:
1. What are the organizing principles used in the presentation of these standards? By which criteria are they categorized?
2. What seems the be the most important and least important aspects of these learning standards? Which skills, topics, and perspectives are prioritized? Do you agree with these emphases and priorities? Why and/or why not?
3. How do these learning standards discuss the learners? What assumptions are being made about students?
4. What most impresses you about these learning standards?
5. What most surprises you about these learning standards?
6. What else would you like to say about these learning standards?

Please use Microsoft Office 365 to share your analysis. Be sure to give me editing privileges (gerald.ardito@mville.edu).

***This work is due by email no later than Monday, February 12 (although you are welcome to get it done sooner).***
