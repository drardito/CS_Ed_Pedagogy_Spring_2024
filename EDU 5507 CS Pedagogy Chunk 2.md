# EDU 5507 - Introduction to CS Pedagogy - Spring 2024


## Course Description
This course is designed to provide teachers and teacher candidates with an introduction to the history, context, methods, and strategies for teaching Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) with students in grades K-12. Through the work of this course, teachers and teacher candidates will engage deeply in the core CS principles (Algorithms and programming, Computing systems, Data and analysis, Impacts of computing, and Networks and the Internet) and will learn to design learning environments and learning experiences that promote deep understanding of these principles in their students. The focus in this course is in developing learning experiences for ***novice*** CS learners at all age levels.

Here is the work for Week 1. As we discussed, you will be started on our two parallel projects:
* Analyzing National (mostly) Computer Science Curriculum
* Developing a Computer Science Curriculum

## Chunk 2: CS Ed Pedagogies

Now that you have completed your deep dive into the CS Learning Standards developed by a)  the [New York State Education Department (NYSED)](https://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards);  and b) the [Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA)](https://csteachers.org/k12standards/interactive/), it is time to start to think about how best to engage students in grades PreK to 12 in Computer Science and Digital Fluency skills, concepts, and mindsets. To do this, we will immerse ourselves in some of the foundational documents in CS Education.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, Seymour Papert and his colleagues at MIT, Marvin Minsky and Cynthia Solomon, with others, developed LOGO, a programming language designed for children. Here is Cynthia Solomon teaching students in some of this early work.

Here is some video describing this work:

So, we are going to start on work in CS Pedagogy around these early efforts. We are doing so not because the history is important (and it is), but the course principles and values that infused this work live on today in some modern descendants of LOGO - Scratch and Snap!. We are going to look at some foundational documents to see how these pioneers conceptualized computing and the teaching of computing for children. Once you have reviewed these standards documents in detail, please prepare an analysis of them. You analysis should analyze each individually and then collectively.

### Readings for this Chunk
Here are some readings to get us started.
1. Papert and Solomon, 1972.  [Twenty Things to Do with a Computer](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EXb97vAChJNFled2QRt-x_sBCZJG--O6QCm_Ef3WZFgTGg?e=O6ql86). This is likely the first publication to document CS Education to PreK - 12 students.
2. Tipps and Bull, [Logo Exchange](https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/resources/nlx/index.html), 1982 - Present. This is a collection of monthly newsletters for teachers and others in ways to work with LOGO with students. Peruse three or four issues (and as many after that as you like). 
3. Bull, Garofalo, and Nguyen, 2019. [An Introduction to Computational Thinking Through Art, Music, and Games](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/ERq0S2waOU9IlOv3jjUV224BFLlOXJ66qVc_z8qNnKafRg?e=HNc7Jg). Glen Bull and his team at University of Virginia have continued to pioneer the teaching and learning of CS o PreK - 12 students. Note that Bull was also on of the editors of the Logo Exchange.


As you read these texts, please thing about the the key pedagogical ideas, principles, and strategies that are discussed and/or which underly them. Please use your current or a new Microsoft Office 365 document to capture and share your analysis. Be sure to give me editing privileges (gerald.ardito@mville.edu).

***This work is due by email no later than Monday, February 26 (although you are welcome to get it done sooner).***
