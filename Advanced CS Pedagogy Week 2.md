# Work for Week 2

Here is the work for Week 1. As we discussed, we will continue to move forward on both of our you will two parallel projects:
* Analyzing National (mostly) Computer Science Curriculum
* Developing a Computer Science Curriculum

## Analyzing Curriculum

Here are the curricula you have chosen to examine (at least to start):

* Jim - Australia
* Ed - Ireland
* Karen - England

Now that you have done your first cut at analyzing one of these national computer science/technology curricula, you have two options for our next steps:

***Option 1:*** Do a depper dive in into the nationa curriculum you have been working with. This deeper dive would include: a) exploring more deeply the materials and specifics of the curriculum; and b) investing the infrastructure created (or not) around the curriculum (as we saw with England) into the support and training of teachers.

***Option 2:*** Pick one of the other national curricula and investigate it. In this option, you would be focused on comparing and contrasting the two curricula you are working with.

**BONUS!** ***Option 3***: If you have another way to expand, further, and deepen this work, I am open to suggestions.

In case you choose Option 2, here are the original prompts we used:
* What are the topics that form this curriculum? How are those topics organized? Feel free to use a concept map to help with this question.
* What seems to be the most important or fundamental to the people who designed this curriculum?
* What do they do in order to orchestrate levels of abstraction in the computer science content and levels of complexity in what is being asked of students?
* What most impresses you about this curriculum?
* What most surprises you about this curriculum?
* What do you want to know more about?



## Developing Curriculum

You have all done a good job at starting your curriculum design work. As we discussed in our last session, the next chunk of work is to focus on what is fundamental about what you are designing:

* What are the core topics, concepts, etc. in the curriculum you are designing?
* How are these core topics connected to one another?
* What are the underlying fundamental (or enduring) understandings that underlie thse concepts?
* What are the essential questions that shape the curriculum you are designing?
* What else is fundamental about your curriculum? 
  * What do you want the learning environment to look like?
  * How do you want students to work with you and with one another?
  * What are the core pedagogies you want to employ?

### Understanding by Design
In our last session, we discussed the Understanding by Design framework for curriculum design (UbD), and I talked about how it starts by focusing on what you consider essential about what you are planning to teach as a way of accessing transferable understandings. McTighe and Wiggins refer to these as ***Essential Questions*** and ***Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings***.

It might be helpful to refer to Chapters 5 and 6 in the Understand by Design book (see link above) as you formulate your Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings.

## Structure

Please organize the artifacts in your work using whatever tools make sense to, and then share them to Mattermost at least once before next **Tuesday, July 19**, using the [Adv CS Pedagogy Week 2 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/cspedagogy/channels/adv-cs-pedagogy-week-2).
