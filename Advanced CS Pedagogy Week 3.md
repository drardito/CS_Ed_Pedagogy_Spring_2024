# Work for Week 3

Here is the work for Week 3. As we discussed, we will continue to move on the development of the curriulum you are designing. The analysis you have done (and may want to revisit) will take on a role of inspiration for the curriculum design work.
* Analyzing National (mostly) Computer Science Curriculum
* Developing a Computer Science Curriculum

## Analyzing Curriculum

Here are the curricula you have chosen to examine (at least to start):

* Jim - Australia
* Ed - Ireland
* Karen - England

As we discussed in our last session, the formal work of exploring and analyzing these other nationa CS curricula is done for now. However, please continue to refer to them as an inspiration for your own curricula, and **please note** these points of inspiration.


## Developing Curriculum

You have all done a good job at continuing to deepen your curriculum design work. As we discussed in our last session, the next chunk of work is focus on the areas we discussed (Jim - Creating concept maps of topics and how they thread through the entire curriculum; Ed - Developing one or two full units with assessments that match the learning environment you are creating; Karen - mapping the entire *course* against relevant learning standards, learning envirnonment guiding principles, and Big Ideas/Essential Questions).

By the time we are done on August 5th, you will have developed an overall plan for your curriculum (see [here](https://github.com/drardito/CS_Ed_Pedagogy_Summer_2022/blob/main/Bartlett%20Environmental%20Course%20Curriculum.md) for an example), as well as the units of which your curriculum is comprised (see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lQpZdLgIvW9EtHDwPPsEsGUIFyibxw_8hwX65xdOZq0/edit?usp=sharing) for the unit planning worksheet we used in Summer 1). So, in the spirit of backwards design, keep this final goal in mind as you do the work immediately in front of you.

Remember, too, that I will look at any sized chunk of work at any time you would like feedback.


### Understanding by Design
In our last session, we discussed the Understanding by Design framework for curriculum design (UbD), and I talked about how it starts by focusing on what you consider essential about what you are planning to teach as a way of accessing transferable understandings. McTighe and Wiggins refer to these as ***Essential Questions*** and ***Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings***.

It might be helpful to continue to refer to Chapters 5 and 6 in the Understand by Design book (see link above) as you formulate your Essential Questions and Big Ideas/Enduring Understandings. In addition, as you design units and their assessments, it will be helpful to look over **Chapter 7**, entitled *"Thinking Like an Assessor."*

## Structure

Please organize the artifacts in your work using whatever tools make sense to, and then share them to Mattermost at least once before next **Tuesday, July 26**, using the [Adv CS Pedagogy Week 3 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/cspedagogy/channels/adv-cs-pedagogy-week-3).
