# Work for Week 1

Here is the work for Week 1. As we discussed, you will be started on our two parallel projects:
* Analyzing National (mostly) Computer Science Curriculum
* Developing a Computer Science Curriculum



## Resources 

[Computer Science Curriculum Documents](https://github.com/drardito/CS_Ed_Pedagogy_Summer_2022/blob/main/National%20Computer%20ScienceTechnology%20Curricula.md)

## Analyzing Curriculum

Here are the curricula you have chosen to examine (at least to start):

* Jim - Australia
* Ed - Ireland
* Karen - England

Now that you have picked the curriculum that you're going to explore, investigate, analyze, it's time to dig in.

Here are some prompts to get you started:

* What are the topics that form this curriculum? How are those topics organized? Feel free to use a concept map to help with this question.
* What seems to be the most important or fundamental to the people who designed this curriculum?
* What do they do in order to orchestrate levels of abstraction in the computer science content and levels of complexity in what is being asked of students?
* What most impresses you about this curriculum?
* What most surprises you about this curriculum?
* What do you want to know more about?



## Developing Curriculum

As you are beginning to plan the curriculum that you're going to design during this course, you should start by focusing on these things:

* What is the learning context? 
  * What school? What grades? How often does the class meet? Is it for all students or just some students? Anything else relevant to the learning context?
* What are your goals for your students as result of the curriculum you plan on designing?
* What topics /computer science/computational thinking skills, practices, etc. do you want to include in your curriculum?
* Which learning standards ([NYSED](http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards) and [CSTA](https://csteachers.org/page/about-csta-s-k-12-nbsp-standards)) will shape the curriculum you are designing?
* What other guiding principles or vision will shape the curriculum you are designing? 
* What are the influences (references, resources, etc.) for the curriculum you are designing? 
* Give some thought to possible area(s) of integration(s) with other teachers and content areas. 



## Structure

Please organize the artifacts in your work using whatever tools make sense to, and then share them to Mattermost at least once before next **Tuesday, July 1**, using the [Adv CS Pedagogy Week 1 Channel](https://gardito-mattermost.us.reclaim.cloud/cspedagogy/channels/adv-cs-pedagogy-week-1).
