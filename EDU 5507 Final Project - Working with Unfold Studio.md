<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zgZLSRT.png" alt="screen of unfold studio text" style="zoom:150%;" />

The goal of this project multifold:

1. ***Learn*** in some depth a platform that uses coding to allow teachers and students to generate interactive text ([Unfold Studio](https://unfold.studio/)).
2. ***Develop student facing materials*** in [Unfold Studio](https://unfold.studio/) that students can use to explore and create interactive text.
3. ***Develop curricular materials**, also using Unfold Studio, that other teachers can use with their student in order to teach a set of key ideas and concepts central to *computer science*.



## The Project

By design, this is intended to be an immersive experience. So, ***dive in***, ***play around***, ***discover***, ***apply***, and ***reflect***.

1. **Dive In**. Go to Unfold Studio and set up a (free) account. Browse some projects. Explore the [User Guide](https://docs.unfold.studio/user_guide/index.html) and play around to see how things work. Create your first document(s). Reflect on what you are learning and how you might use this with students.
2. **Think Like a Student**. Use what you have learned by playing around to create one or more documents. Share them with me and whomever else you wish.
3. **Think Like a Teacher**. Now that you are thinking like student, it's time to think like a teacher. Look over the [Teaching Guide](https://docs.unfold.studio/teaching/index.html) and start to think about the curricular materials you can design. Ideally, design them directly in Unfold Studio. Of course, you will share them as well.
4. **Put it All Together**. Now you will collect your various artifacts and bundle them together. Then, you should reflect on the entire process of playing around, thinking like a student, and thinking like a teacher. 



This project is due no later than ***Friday May 3rd***.
