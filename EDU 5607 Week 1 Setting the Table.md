Here is what you can do to get started:

1. **Presentation.** Please watch[ this presentation on the learning theory of Connectivism](https://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?presentation=577) by its co-author, Stephen Downes. This work will provide a conceptual framework for the active learning which will shape our work in the course. Please note his ARRFF Process Model - Framework for Practice.

2. [Review NYSED CS/Digital Fluency Standards](https://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards). I know you have seen these before, but it will be good to load them back up into RAM.

3. **Read my papers** analyzing the NYSED and CSTA CS Learning Standards. By the way, you do not need to agree with my analyses.
